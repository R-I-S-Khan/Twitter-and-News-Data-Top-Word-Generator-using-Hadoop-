# Data Aggregation, Big Data Analysis and Visualization using Hadoop

This is the 2nd project of the course CSE487 [Data Intensive Computing] offered in Spring 2018.

It was required to collect twitter data and news data using API, find the cooccurence of the words 
and then find out the top ten words occuring in both of the news data and twitter data. In that way anyone would be able to find 
which topics are the most relevant both in the social media and news at that time. Afterwards it was required to make a website 
from the collected results.
